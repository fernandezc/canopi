// The curve a row of plants follows (plan §4 "2.0 plant along a path", A3; spec §1.11): a smooth curve through every
// point of a path, flattened to a polyline with its cumulative lengths. Each run of points between sharp points is a
// centripetal Catmull-Rom spline (alpha 0.5, knot intervals the square root of the chord), whose ends take a phantom
// neighbour reflected through them; a sharp point breaks the curve, so a segment between two sharp points (or a path's
// open ends) is straight. A curve segment is sampled 64 times, about 1.5 mm off the curve in 60 m. Points within 1e-6 m
// of the one before collapse into it. Only +, -, *, / and Math.sqrt touch the coordinates, all correctly rounded in every
// engine, so V8 and JavaScriptCore flatten a path to the same bits. Pure: it imports only types (P54).
